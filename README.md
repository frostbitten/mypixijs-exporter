# MyPixiJS-Exporter

Aims to deliver an enhanced version of the PixiJS exporter for [TexturePacker](https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) (https://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)

## Enhanced features
1. **`Location Prefix`** Similar to `Texture path` but it affects the individual sprites, not the spritesheet texture.

## Code quality, etc
This is pretty much made entirely with Chat-GPT 4. I fed it examples of what currently gets exported, parts of the docs, and made it update any hardcoded values to utilize variables provided in the environment.
You can read the whole back-and-forth development convo at the link below. The first half is actually abandoned code, you'll see where I ask to use the JavaScript method instead of templates: https://chat.openai.com/share/28bf517d-eceb-42e7-b4dc-509d0b34b18e
